SoloLakehouse is a self-contained, cloud-neutral lakehouse reference platform that shows how the pieces behind a modern, audit-ready data platform fit together without depending on a managed SaaS lakehouse service.

It is built end-to-end on Docker Compose — small enough to read in a weekend, complete enough to discuss production trade-offs, and explicit enough to map onto DORA, BaFin BAIT/MaRisk, and EU AI Act Title III obligations.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <em>v2.5 baseline: local-first lakehouse with orchestration, governance, BI, ML tracking, and Iceberg Gold tables.</em>
</p>


```text
Data sources
  -> Python ingestion + validation
  -> MinIO Bronze/Silver Parquet
  -> Trino + Hive Metastore
  -> Iceberg Gold tables
  -> Superset dashboards + MLflow experiments

Platform services:
  PostgreSQL, Dagster, OpenMetadata, Superset, MLflow
```

The detailed architecture is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), and the medallion conventions are in [docs/medallion-model.md](docs/medallion-model.md).

## What It Solves

Most lakehouse tutorials show **how to plug components together**. SoloLakehouse is built to answer the harder questions a regulated European platform team actually faces:

| Problem the platform answers | How SoloLakehouse addresses it |
|---|---|
| **"If BaFin asks for end-to-end lineage of this Gold table tomorrow, can we deliver it in 24h?"** | Three-source lineage join (OpenMetadata + Iceberg snapshots + Dagster runs) producing signable evidence packs to a WORM bucket. *([v2.6 — planned](docs/history/v2.6-planning.md))* |
| **"Are we locked into our vendor's table format?"** | Iceberg Gold tables readable by Trino today, with documented multi-engine paths (Spark / DuckDB / Flink) and Hive-Metastore ↔ REST-Catalog switch. *([v2.7 — planned](docs/history/v2.7-planning.md))* |
| **"Can we trace any model artifact back to the exact training data, code commit, and orchestration run?"** | MLflow runs bound to Iceberg snapshot id + Dagster run id + code commit + data-contract hash, with auto-generated EU AI Act Art.13 model cards. *([v2.8 — planned](docs/history/v2.8-planning.md))* |
| **"Can the same stack run on a laptop and on Kubernetes without rewriting?"** | All services are containerized, configuration-externalized, state-externalized; v3.0 promotes the same images to K8s + Helm + Terraform. *([v2.9](docs/history/v2.9-planning.md) → [v3.0](docs/history/v3-planning.md))* |


## Quick Start

From a cold clone, the full stack starts through one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jiahong-Que-9527/SoloLakehouse.git
cd SoloLakehouse
make setup
```

`make setup` creates `.env` from `.env.example`, prepares `.venv`, installs Python dependencies, pulls images, starts the Compose stack, bootstraps databases, and waits for service health checks.

Validate the stack, open the local operator portal, and run the end-to-end demo:

```bash
make verify
make health
make demo
```

Operator portal: `http://127.0.0.1:8090/health`

The portal shows entity identity, service health, demo readiness, links to the
core UIs, and the `make verify` -> Dagster -> Bronze/Silver/Gold -> Trino
demo path.

Key UIs:

- Dagster: `http://localhost:3000`
- Superset: `http://localhost:8088`
- OpenMetadata: `http://localhost:8585`
- MLflow: `http://localhost:5000`
- Trino: `http://localhost:8080`
- MinIO Console: `http://localhost:9001`

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md), [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md), [DEMO.md](DEMO.md), and [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) for details, sizing, credentials, and troubleshooting.

## Demo

## Capabilities Demonstrated (v2.5)

- **Medallion architecture** with strict Bronze immutability, Pydantic-v2 schema validation at ingestion, and Iceberg-backed Gold
- **Asset-aware orchestration** in Dagster — jobs, schedules, sensors, asset checks, and lineage in the UI (not task-based DAGs)
- **Federated query** across Hive (Bronze/Silver) and Iceberg (Gold) catalogs via a single Trino endpoint
- **Open table format discipline** — Iceberg Gold tables managed via Trino CTAS, no proprietary engine lock-in
- **ML governance baseline** — MLflow experiments with object-storage artifacts; `TimeSeriesSplit` CV as a discipline (look-ahead bias is treated as a defect, not a default)
- **Catalog & BI integration** — OpenMetadata for lineage and ownership, Superset for SQL-first BI on Trino
- **Production-minded engineering** — CI gates, type checking, ADRs per non-trivial decision, release notes and planning notes per minor version

The reference data domain is European financial markets — ECB Statistical Data Warehouse interest rates and the DAX equity index — chosen deliberately because it surfaces real-world challenges in temporal joins, look-ahead bias, and regulatory data lineage. The active runtime is **v2.5**; historical v1/v2 material is preserved under [docs/history/](docs/history/).

## Engineering Practices

Beyond the platform features, this is built with explicit engineering discipline a hiring panel can audit:

- **Test discipline** — pure-function transforms unit-tested without Docker; Pydantic v2 schema validation on every Bronze record; quality checks fail-fast rather than silent-degrade
- **Type discipline** — `mypy` over `ingestion/`, `transformations/`, `ml/`, `scripts/`, `dagster/`
- **Lint discipline** — `ruff` enforced in CI
- **Architecture discipline** — every non-trivial decision recorded as an [ADR](docs/decisions/README.md)
- **Release discipline** — version-tagged release notes, planning note per minor version, evolution timeline at [docs/history/timeline.md](docs/history/timeline.md)
- **Observability discipline** — `structlog` JSON events at every step boundary; SLO emit pipeline planned for [v2.9](docs/history/v2.9-planning.md)
- **CI** — GitHub Actions runs lint + typecheck + tests on every push

## Evolution Roadmap

The platform evolves along a single narrative: **first make it run, then make every claim provable on the same Compose stack, and only then migrate the runtime to Kubernetes.** v2.5 is the live runtime today (capabilities listed above). Each minor version after that adds **one category of evidence** the platform can produce — without changing the runtime.

| Version | Theme | Problem | Focus |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| **v2.5** *(delivered)* | Platform can run | local-first lakehouse baseline | reproducible Docker Compose stack, Bronze/Silver/Gold flow, Trino, Dagster, MLflow, OpenMetadata, Superset |
| **v2.6** *(planned)* | Platform can produce evidence | regulatory lineage & audit readiness | Dagster + OpenMetadata + Iceberg three-source lineage join, signable audit evidence pack on WORM storage, **DORA 24h / BaFin-style** traceability, data contracts as the gate |
| **v2.7** *(planned)* | Platform can prove openness | data sovereignty & vendor lock-in | multi-engine Iceberg demo (Trino / Spark / DuckDB / Flink), Hive Metastore ↔ Iceberg REST Catalog switch, signable sovereignty report + exit playbook, Databricks-to-Iceberg migration PoC |
| **v2.8** *(planned)* | Platform can govern AI | compliant AI / model traceability | MLflow ↔ Iceberg snapshot five-tuple binding (snapshot_id, dagster.run_id, feature_version, code_commit, data_contract_hash), auto **EU AI Act Art.13** model card, ML asset checks for performance regression *(model serving stays out — ADR-011)* |
| **v2.9** *(planned)* | Platform has production shape | operational readiness | SLO emit + Superset "Platform Health" dashboard, `.env.shared` vs `.env.secrets` discipline, promotion/rollback drill with `make` entrypoints, Iceberg snapshot rollback drill, K8s readiness gate before v3.0 |
| **v3.0** *(planned)* | Platform can run in production | scalable deployment & environment management | Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, dev/stage/prod separation, managed secrets, GitOps-ready deployment model |
| **v4.0** *(planned)* | Self-serve usability | docs-first onboarding | repeatable verification, clearer failure modes, operational polish |

## Portability & Migration Paths

The platform is built around **replaceable boundaries** — not because every component will be replaced, but because every component **could** be without rewriting the platform contract:

| Boundary | Current (v2.5) | Migration target | Trigger criteria |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Object storage | MinIO | SeaweedFS / Ceph / S3 / GCS | scale beyond single-node throughput; multi-region requirement |
| Runtime | Docker Compose | Kubernetes + Helm + Terraform | multi-environment promotion; HA / SLO requirement *(v3.0)* |
| Metadata DB | Local PostgreSQL 17 | Managed / HA PostgreSQL | RPO < 24h or production SLO commitment |
| Catalog | Hive Metastore | Iceberg REST Catalog | multi-engine demand or vendor-neutral catalog requirement *(v2.7)* |
| Secrets | `.env` files | Vault / cloud KMS | multi-tenant or multi-environment deployment *(v3.0)* |
| BI / Catalog | Superset / OpenMetadata | Enterprise tool (Looker, Atlan, etc.) | enterprise procurement constraints |

Each boundary has a corresponding ADR explaining the current choice and the explicit conditions under which it should change. See the [ADR index](docs/decisions/README.md).

## Can My Machine Run This?

Minimum local profile for the full v2.5 stack:

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---:|---:|
| CPU | 4 cores | 6+ cores |
| Free RAM | 8 GB | 12+ GB |
| Free disk | 10 GB | 20+ GB |

Required software:

| Software | Version |
|---|---|
| Git | 2.40+ |
| Docker Engine / Desktop | 24.0+ |
| Docker Compose plugin | v2.20+ |
| Python | 3.13+ |
| make | any recent GNU/BSD make |

OS compatibility:

| OS | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Supported | Primary local path |
| macOS | Supported | Docker Desktop required |
| Windows WSL2 | Supported | Run commands inside the Linux distro |
| Native Windows shell | Not supported | Use WSL2 |

First run usually takes 10-15 minutes on a typical laptop because Docker pulls OpenMetadata, Superset, Trino, MLflow, and database images. If your network is slow, budget 20-30 minutes for image pulls.
