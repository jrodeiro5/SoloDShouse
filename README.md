---

SoloLakehouse is a readable, runnable, cloud-neutral lakehouse reference architecture. It shows how the pieces behind a modern data platform fit together without relying on a managed SaaS layer.

It is not a framework or library. It is a production-minded reference stack you can run locally, inspect end to end, fork, critique, and extend.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/img/SLHv2.5_architecutre.png" alt="SoloLakehouse v2.5 architecture">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>v2.5 baseline: local-first lakehouse with orchestration, governance, BI, ML tracking, and Iceberg Gold tables.</em>
</p>


```text
Data sources
  -> Python ingestion + validation
  -> MinIO Bronze/Silver Parquet
  -> Trino + Hive Metastore
  -> Iceberg Gold tables
  -> Superset dashboards + MLflow experiments

Platform services:
  PostgreSQL, Dagster, OpenMetadata, Superset, MLflow
```

The detailed architecture is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), and the medallion conventions are in [docs/medallion-model.md](docs/medallion-model.md).

## Why SoloLakehouse Exists

Enterprise data platforms are often explained through vendor products: Databricks, Snowflake, managed Airflow, managed catalogs, managed object storage, managed everything. SoloLakehouse takes the opposite route. It exposes the core platform mechanics on one local runtime so the architecture is understandable, portable, and owned by the engineer running it.

The project exists to demonstrate:

| Principle | What it means in SoloLakehouse |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Cloud independence** | The platform runs locally with open-source components and avoids requiring a managed cloud lakehouse service. |
| **Compliance awareness** | Data boundaries, service responsibilities, metadata, release checks, and architecture decisions are explicit rather than implied. |
| **Portability** | Storage, orchestration, catalog, BI, and deployment layers have documented migration paths. |
| **Platform engineering capability** | The project demonstrates orchestration, data quality, metadata, ML tracking, BI access, CI, ADRs, release discipline, and roadmap ownership. |
| **Readable architecture** | The stack is intentionally small enough to inspect but complete enough to discuss production trade-offs. |


## Quick Start

Requirements: Docker with the Compose plugin, Python 3.13+, and `make`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jiahong-Que-9527/SoloLakehouse.git
cd SoloLakehouse
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make setup
```

Validate the stack and run the pipeline:

```bash
make verify
make pipeline
```

Key UIs:

- Dagster: `http://localhost:3000`
- Superset: `http://localhost:8088`
- OpenMetadata: `http://localhost:8585`
- MLflow: `http://localhost:5000`
- Trino: `http://localhost:8080`
- MinIO Console: `http://localhost:9001`

See [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) and [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for details, sizing, credentials, and troubleshooting.

## What It Demonstrates

- End-to-end medallion flow: **sources -> Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> BI / ML**.
- Dagster asset orchestration with jobs, schedules, sensors, and checks.
- Trino SQL over Hive and Iceberg catalogs.
- Gold-layer Iceberg tables managed through Trino.
- MLflow experiment tracking with artifacts on object storage.
- OpenMetadata catalog integration and Superset BI access.
- CI, release checks, ADRs, and a candid self-assessment of current limits.

Current demo data uses ECB SDW API data and DAX sample data. The active runtime is **v2.5 only**; historical v1/v2 material lives in [docs/history/](docs/history/).

## Evolution Roadmap

The platform evolves along a single narrative: **first make it run, then make every claim provable on the same Compose stack, and only then migrate the runtime to Kubernetes.** Each minor version after v2.5 adds one category of evidence the platform can produce.

| Version | Theme | Problem | Focus |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| **v2.5** *(delivered)* | Platform can run | local-first lakehouse baseline | reproducible Docker Compose stack, Bronze/Silver/Gold flow, Trino, Dagster, MLflow, OpenMetadata, Superset |
| **v2.6** *(planned)* | Platform can produce evidence | regulatory lineage & audit readiness | Dagster + OpenMetadata + Iceberg three-source lineage join, signable audit evidence pack on WORM storage, **DORA 24h / BaFin-style** traceability, data contracts as the gate |
| **v2.7** *(planned)* | Platform can prove openness | data sovereignty & vendor lock-in | multi-engine Iceberg demo (Trino / Spark / DuckDB / Flink), Hive Metastore ↔ Iceberg REST Catalog switch, signable sovereignty report + exit playbook, Databricks-to-Iceberg migration PoC |
| **v2.8** *(planned)* | Platform can govern AI | compliant AI / model traceability | MLflow ↔ Iceberg snapshot five-tuple binding (snapshot_id, dagster.run_id, feature_version, code_commit, data_contract_hash), auto **EU AI Act Art.13** model card, ML asset checks for performance regression *(model serving stays out — ADR-011)* |
| **v2.9** *(planned)* | Platform has production shape | operational readiness | SLO emit + Superset "Platform Health" dashboard, `.env.shared` vs `.env.secrets` discipline, promotion/rollback drill with `make` entrypoints, Iceberg snapshot rollback drill, K8s readiness gate before v3.0 |
| **v3.0** *(planned)* | Platform can run in production | scalable deployment & environment management | Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, dev/stage/prod separation, managed secrets, GitOps-ready deployment model |
| **v4.0** *(planned)* | Self-serve usability | docs-first onboarding | repeatable verification, clearer failure modes, operational polish |

Per-version planning notes:

- v2.5 — [docs/history/v2.5-planning.md](docs/history/v2.5-planning.md)
- v2.6 — [docs/history/v2.6-planning.md](docs/history/v2.6-planning.md)
- v2.7 — [docs/history/v2.7-planning.md](docs/history/v2.7-planning.md)
- v2.8 — [docs/history/v2.8-planning.md](docs/history/v2.8-planning.md)
- v2.9 — [docs/history/v2.9-planning.md](docs/history/v2.9-planning.md)
- v3.0 — [docs/history/v3-planning.md](docs/history/v3-planning.md)

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the canonical version status table, and [docs/history/timeline.md](docs/history/timeline.md) for the full evolution timeline.

## Portability Notes

The stack is intentionally built around replaceable boundaries:

- MinIO can evolve toward SeaweedFS, Ceph, or cloud object storage.
- Docker Compose can evolve toward Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.
- Local PostgreSQL can evolve toward managed or HA PostgreSQL.
- Superset and OpenMetadata can be swapped for enterprise BI/catalog tools.
- Local secrets can evolve toward Vault or cloud secret managers.

These trade-offs are documented in the [ADR index](docs/decisions/README.md).

If this architecture is useful, star the repo so more platform engineers can find it.

Architecture critiques are welcome, especially around governance hardening, migration paths, and v3 productionization priorities.
