# Product Entity Contract

This contract defines what makes one SoloLakehouse-derived product entity
complete enough to operate independently.

SoloLakehouse remains the upstream template. `finlakehouse` and
`aviation-lakehouse` are product instances created from that template, each with
its own identity, runtime state, buckets, metadata labels, schedules, evidence,
and upgrade lifecycle.

## Status

- Applies to: v2.5 entity-template preparation.
- Related task: Phase 1, "Define the Entity Contract".
- Related issue: #3.
- Current storage provider: MinIO, treated as the initial S3-compatible object
  store provider rather than as product identity.

## Contract principles

1. A product entity is identified by stable logical fields such as
   `PRODUCT_ID`, domain, dataset namespace, ownership metadata, and upgrade
   strategy.
2. Runtime hosts, bucket names, warehouse URIs, service URLs, bind mounts, and
   backup paths are physical deployment details. They can change during
   side-by-side migration without changing the logical product identity.
3. Logical dataset IDs must survive storage provider changes, bucket renames,
   and v2.6+ governance upgrades.
4. Entity-specific values must come from environment/configuration, not code
   edits to the shared SoloLakehouse template.
5. The first entity split keeps MinIO. Object-store replacement is a later,
   separate migration. See
   [Object Store Abstraction and MinIO Deferral](object-store-abstraction.md)
   for the provider/configuration boundary.

## Required fields

Implementation note: `DATA_BUCKET` and `WAREHOUSE_URI` are active runtime
settings for entity data and Hive/Trino warehouse locations. `BUCKET_NAME`
remains supported as a v2.5 compatibility alias. `AUDIT_BUCKET`,
`MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_BUCKET`, and `MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_ROOT` are active runtime settings
for bucket initialization, verification, and MLflow artifact storage.

Runtime identity fields such as `PRODUCT_ID`, `PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME`,
`PRODUCT_DOMAIN`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `RUNTIME_VERSION`, and `TRINO_USER` are active
for health/verification labels and Trino client defaults. `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`
is documented as the entity-level Compose identity value, but the current
Compose files still keep explicit `slh-*` container names for local compatibility
until runtime state layout work changes that contract.
If `TRINO_USER` is omitted, runtime clients derive a safe default from
`PRODUCT_ID` by normalizing unsupported characters to underscores (for example,
`aviation-lakehouse` becomes `aviation_lakehouse`). Operators may still set
`TRINO_USER` explicitly in `.env` when a service requires a different username.

## Logical identity vs physical deployment

Use this separation when adding configuration, documentation, dashboards, or
future governance artifacts.

### Stable logical identity

These values describe what the product entity is. They should remain stable
across host moves, bucket migrations, object-store replacement, and v2.6+
governance upgrades:

- `PRODUCT_ID`
- product display name
- domain
- dataset namespace
- owner
- logical dataset IDs
- OpenMetadata logical service naming convention
- Superset entity labeling convention
- upgrade strategy

Changing one of these fields is a product rename or governance migration, not a
routine deployment change.

### Physical deployment details

These values describe where and how the entity currently runs. They may change
during side-by-side migration while the product identity remains the same:

- runtime host and host paths
- Docker Compose project name
- object-store provider and endpoints
- data, audit, and MLflow artifact bucket names
- warehouse URI
- service URLs
- database connection details
- backup root
- local bind mounts under `docker/data/` or `/opt/<product_id>/data/`

When physical details change, update environment files, runbooks, metadata
ingestion configuration, and restore procedures. Do not rename logical dataset
IDs solely because storage moved.

## Entity configuration examples

### FinLakehouse

```bash
PRODUCT_ID=finlakehouse
PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME=FinLakehouse
PRODUCT_DOMAIN=financial_markets
DATASET_NAMESPACE=fin
PRODUCT_OWNER="Jiahong Que"
RUNTIME_VERSION=slh-v2.5.1
ENVIRONMENT=prod
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=finlakehouse

OBJECT_STORE_PROVIDER=minio
OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000
OBJECT_STORE_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000

DATA_BUCKET=finlakehouse-data
AUDIT_BUCKET=finlakehouse-audit
MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_BUCKET=finlakehouse-mlflow
WAREHOUSE_URI=s3a://finlakehouse-data/warehouse/

TRINO_USER=finlakehouse
TRINO_URL=http://localhost:8080
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
OPENMETADATA_URL=http://localhost:8585
OPENMETADATA_TRINO_SERVICE_NAME=finlakehouse-trino
SUPERSET_URL=http://localhost:8088
SUPERSET_TRINO_DATABASE_LABEL=finlakehouse_trino

UPGRADE_STRATEGY=side_by_side
```

Initial domain scope:

- ECB interest rates
- DAX daily index data
- existing Bronze -> Silver -> Gold flow
- existing MLflow experiment path
- OpenMetadata and Superset integration under FinLakehouse labels

### Aviation Lakehouse

```bash
PRODUCT_ID=aviation-lakehouse
PRODUCT_DISPLAY_NAME="Aviation Lakehouse"
PRODUCT_DOMAIN=aviation_operations
DATASET_NAMESPACE=aviation
PRODUCT_OWNER="Jiahong Que"
RUNTIME_VERSION=slh-v2.5.1
ENVIRONMENT=prod
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=aviation-lakehouse

OBJECT_STORE_PROVIDER=minio
OBJECT_STORE_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000
OBJECT_STORE_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000

DATA_BUCKET=aviation-lakehouse-data
AUDIT_BUCKET=aviation-lakehouse-audit
MLFLOW_ARTIFACT_BUCKET=aviation-lakehouse-mlflow
WAREHOUSE_URI=s3a://aviation-lakehouse-data/warehouse/

TRINO_USER=aviation_lakehouse
TRINO_URL=http://localhost:8080
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
OPENMETADATA_URL=http://localhost:8585
OPENMETADATA_TRINO_SERVICE_NAME=aviation-lakehouse-trino
SUPERSET_URL=http://localhost:8088
SUPERSET_TRINO_DATABASE_LABEL=aviation_lakehouse_trino

UPGRADE_STRATEGY=side_by_side
```

Initial domain scope must be designed separately from FinLakehouse. Aviation
Lakehouse should not be a financial dataset rename. Before implementation,
define:

- authoritative aviation source systems
- ingestion frequency
- Bronze raw schema
- Silver cleaned schema
- first Gold product
- expected consumers
- freshness and retention expectations
- whether MLflow is required immediately

## Runtime root layout

For continuously operated product entities, prefer a host root owned by the
entity. See [Entity Runtime State Layout](runtime-state-layout.md) for bind
mount ownership, `.env` handling, and side-by-side upgrade layouts.

```text
/opt/<product_id>/app/       # checked-out code or release artifact
/opt/<product_id>/data/      # runtime bind mounts
/opt/<product_id>/backup/    # local backup staging
/opt/<product_id>/logs/      # optional host-level logs
/opt/<product_id>/.env       # entity-specific configuration
```

The local SoloLakehouse reference may continue to use repository-local
`docker/data/` bind mounts. Product entities should document whether the
repository checkout itself is the runtime root or whether bind mounts live under
`/opt/<product_id>/data/`.

## Dataset identity boundary

Dataset IDs are logical identities and are not storage paths. They should map to
current physical locations through configuration and governance metadata.
See [Dataset ID and Governance Naming Convention](dataset-governance-naming.md)
for naming rules, current FinLakehouse mappings, Aviation Lakehouse
placeholders, and v2.6 lineage evidence fields.

Examples:

```text
fin.ecb_rates_bronze
fin.dax_daily_bronze
fin.ecb_rates_silver
fin.dax_daily_silver
fin.ecb_dax_features_gold

aviation.<source>_bronze
aviation.<cleaned_dataset>_silver
aviation.<feature_dataset>_gold
```

When buckets, warehouses, or object-store providers change, preserve these
logical IDs and update their physical mappings.

## Minimum acceptance checklist

A product entity contract is complete when:

- required fields above are present for the entity;
- logical identity fields are separated from physical deployment details;
- data, audit, and MLflow artifact buckets are unique to the entity;
- warehouse URI points at the entity data bucket;
- OpenMetadata and Superset labels are entity-specific;
- Dagster state is entity-local;
- backup root and restore target assumptions are documented;
- upgrade strategy is `side_by_side`;
- MinIO is recorded as the current object-store provider, not the product
  identity.
