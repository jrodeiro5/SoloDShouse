# SoloLakehouse v2.5 Demo Script

This is the fixed recording script for a 20-30 minute v2.5 walkthrough.

The goal is not to show every feature. The goal is to prove, in one take, that a fresh clone can start the stack, move real financial-market data through Bronze, Silver, and Gold, query it through Trino, and inspect orchestration and lineage surfaces.

## Preconditions

- Use a fresh clone on Linux, macOS, or WSL2.
- Confirm Docker has at least 4 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM, and 10 GB free disk.
- Keep one terminal at the repository root.
- Use browser tabs for:
  - Health dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:8090/health`
  - Dagster: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Trino: `http://localhost:8080`
  - MinIO Console: `http://localhost:9001`
  - MLflow: `http://localhost:5000`
  - OpenMetadata: `http://localhost:8585`

## Timing

| Time | Segment | Action | Evidence |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 00:00-02:00 | Opening | State what SoloLakehouse is and why it exists. | README one-sentence What / Why / How. |
| 02:00-06:00 | Cold start | Run `git clone`, `cd SoloLakehouse`, then `make setup`. | Setup performs env creation, dependency install, image pull, Compose start, and health wait. |
| 06:00-08:00 | Health surface | Run `make health` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8090/health`. | Every service shows PASS or a clear failing service. |
| 08:00-13:00 | Data flow | Run `make demo`. | Dagster executes the demo data-flow job, then Trino row-count check passes for Iceberg Gold. |
| 13:00-17:00 | Three-layer view | Open MinIO and show Bronze, Silver, and Gold Iceberg table paths under the warehouse prefix. | All three medallion layers are visible as Iceberg data files. |
| 17:00-21:00 | Query and compliance angle | Show the Gold SQL check and explain why auditable row counts matter. | `iceberg.gold.ecb_dax_features` returns rows; all layers queryable via `iceberg.*`. |
| 21:00-25:00 | Orchestration | Open Dagster and show the latest successful `demo_data_flow_job` run. | Asset graph and recent run status are visible. |
| 25:00-28:00 | Metadata and ML | Open OpenMetadata and MLflow. | Catalog UI and experiment tracking surface are reachable. |
| 28:00-30:00 | Close | Summarize v2.5 boundary and point to v2.6 roadmap. | v2.5 is a frozen baseline, not a feature backlog. |

## Commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jiahong-Que-9527/SoloLakehouse.git
cd SoloLakehouse
make setup
make verify
make health
make demo
```

For a step-by-step explanation of `make demo`, including the equivalent manual commands and pass/fail criteria for each stage, see [docs/make-demo-guide.md](docs/make-demo-guide.md).

## Demo Data Rule

ECB data must come from the live ECB collector path. DAX data comes from the checked-in real historical OHLCV sample CSV used by the v2.5 demo path. This keeps the demo deterministic while still using financial-market data rather than generated mock rows.

Do not describe the DAX sample as live data. If any source is unavailable or skipped, the recording must explicitly say which source failed and what data path was used instead.

## Fallback Branches

| Failure | Pivot | Recovery command |
|---|---|---|
| Docker daemon is not running | Show README prerequisites and pause the demo. | Start Docker, then rerun `make setup`. |
| OpenMetadata or Superset is slow | Continue with `make verify`, Dagster, Trino, and MinIO; return to the UI later. | Wait 2-5 minutes, then rerun `make verify`. |
| Pipeline fails before Gold | Open Dagster run details and show the failed asset. | `make verify`, then `make demo`. |
| Trino query fails | Show `RUNBOOK.md` Trino debugging path. | `make verify`, inspect `docker logs slh-trino`. |
| MLflow Host header or artifact issue | Show that the demo does not hide failures. | Rebuild MLflow with `make up`, then rerun `make verify`. |

## Pass Criteria

- `make setup` exits 0.
- `make verify` exits 0.
- `make demo` exits 0.
- Health dashboard shows all services as PASS.
- Dagster shows a successful `demo_data_flow_job`.
- Trino returns row count greater than zero for `iceberg.gold.ecb_dax_features`.
